🚀 Project Structure

This project is divided into three main parts:

Backend – This is the Node.js + Express server that connects with MongoDB Atlas. It takes care of authentication, cart operations, and all the APIs used by both the user site and the admin panel.

DevKart (User Site) – The main e-commerce website where users can browse products, sign up, log in, add items to their cart, and manage their shopping.

Admin Panel – A separate React app made for administrators. From here, an admin can log in, add new products, and manage the catalog.

So in short, the backend is the “brain”, DevKart is what the customer sees, and the Admin panel is what the shop owner uses to control everything.
